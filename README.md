# public-tools
I have created this repository to collect the public tools I use during my investigations both as former Security Operations Analyst and my current role as Security Officer. 

This repository contains a HTML bookmark export that was made during my time at [**Fox-IT**](https://www.fox-it.com/) with input from our internal Threat Intelligence team. Any use of these tools is at your own risk and responsibility; be mindful of what you're allowed to do with local laws and such.
